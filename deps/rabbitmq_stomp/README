# RabbitMQ STOMP adapter

## Introduction

This is a STOMP adapter plugin for use with RabbitMQ.

 - <http://stomp.codehaus.org/>
 - <http://www.rabbitmq.com/>
 - <https://dev.rabbitmq.com/wiki/StompGateway>

You can get the code by checking it out from our repository with

    hg clone http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-stomp/

Please make sure that after you have cloned the repository you update
it to the correct tag for your RabbitMQ server version -- see below
for details.

Announcements regarding the adapter are periodically made on the
RabbitMQ mailing list and on LShift's blog.

## Compiling

Once you have the RabbitMQ STOMP adapter code, you will need to
compile it against the RabbitMQ server before configuring it.

### Compiling from released server binary packages

(Please make sure that you have a version of the STOMP plugin code
that is compatible with the version of the server you're using. See
below for more information on this topic.)

Usually, the server packages are installed to
`/usr/lib/erlang/lib/rabbitmq_server-X.Y.Z`. From within the
`rabbitmq-stomp` directory, issue the command

    make RABBIT_SERVER_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/lib/erlang/lib/rabbitmq_server-X.Y.Z/include

### Compiling from released server source code tarballs

(Please make sure that you have a version of the STOMP plugin code
that is compatible with the version of the server you're using. See
below for more information on this topic.)

If you've downloaded a server source code tarball named
`rabbitmq-server-X.Y.Z.zip`, unzip it and create a symbolic link that
aliases the resulting `rabbitmq-server-X.Y.Z` directory to plain old
`rabbitmq-server`:

    unzip rabbitmq-server-X.Y.Z.zip
    ln -s rabbitmq-server-X.Y.Z rabbitmq-server

You will then need to compile the RabbitMQ server code:

    (cd rabbitmq-server; make)

Finally, from within the `rabbitmq-stomp` directory, issue the command

    make

### Making sure the STOMP plugin version matches the server version

Generally, the STOMP plugin's source code repository is tagged when a
new version of the RabbitMQ server is released.

For example, if you are using RabbitMQ server version 1.5.3, then
examine the output of `hg tags` in your local copy of
`rabbitmq-stomp`:

    $ hg tags
    tip                               93:9cd7eba4269c
    rabbitmq_v1_5_3                   91:5ee5e2c0b64a
    rabbitmq_v1_5_1                   65:2eba20816126
    rabbitmq_v1_5_0                   60:1a1ff5067bb6
    rabbitmq_v1_4_0                   49:71b922193057
    Migrated to mercurial             11:a28eea2c2a2b

To make sure your checkout is at the `rabbitmq_v1_5_3` tag, use `hg
update`:

    hg update rabbitmq_v1_5_3

Then proceed with compiling the plugin as explained above.

If there is no specific tag for the version of the server you are
using, try using the newest tag that has the same major and minor
version number. For instance, if you were running RabbitMQ server
version 1.5.4, but no corresponding tag on `rabbitmq-stomp` was
available, you should try using tag `rabbitmq_v1_5_3`. Another
alternative for this hypothetical situation would be to use the tip of
the 1.5.x branch:

    $ hg branches
    default                        93:9cd7eba4269c
    rabbitmq_v1_3_0_branch         45:90dd1726fe0b
    v1_5                           92:0ba97fbaea1f (inactive)
    $ hg update v1_5
    4 files updated, 0 files merged, 5 files removed, 0 files unresolved
    $ 

### Compiling from a Mercurial checkout

If you want to use the bleeding-edge features of the broker and/or the
STOMP adapter, you will need to clone and compile three separate
repositories that work together:

    hg clone http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-server
    hg clone http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-codegen
    hg clone http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-stomp
    (cd rabbitmq-server; make)
    (cd rabbitmq-stomp; make)

### Compiling from anywhere else

If you have a file system layout not covered above, you can
investigate setting the Makefile variables `RABBIT_SOURCE_ROOT`,
`RABBIT_SERVER_SOURCE_ROOT`, and/or `RABBIT_SERVER_INCLUDE_DIR`. For
example, if you had a particular version of `rabbit.hrl` and
`rabbit_framing.hrl` you wanted to use, you might say

    make RABBIT_SERVER_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/include

so that the STOMP adapter source code can find the `rabbit.hrl` and
`rabbit_framing.hrl` files in the `/path/to/include` directory.


## Running the STOMP adapter

### Configuring the server to start the plugin automatically

Most RabbitMQ server packages are set up to cause the server to pick
up configuration from `/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf`. To tell the
server to start your plugin, first make sure it is compiled, and then
add the following text to `/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf`:

    SERVER_START_ARGS='
      -pa /path/to/rabbitmq-stomp/ebin 
      -rabbit
         stomp_listeners [{"0.0.0.0",61613}]

making sure to update the `/path/to/rabbitmq-stomp/ebin` appropriately
for your system. Then restart the server with

    sudo /etc/init.d/rabbitmq-server restart

### Checking that the adapter is running

If the adapter is running, you should be able to connect to port 61613
using a STOMP client of your choice. In a pinch, `telnet` or netcat
(`nc`) will do nicely:

    $ nc localhost 61613
    dummy
    dummy
    ERROR
    message:Invalid frame
    content-type:text/plain
    content-length:22
    
    Could not parse frame
    $ 

That `ERROR` message indicates that the adapter is listening and
attempting to parse STOMP frames.

Another option is to try out the examples that come with the STOMP
adapter -- see below.

### Running the adapter during development

If you are working with the full source code for the RabbitMQ server,
and you either have the `../rabbitmq-server` directory or
`RABBIT_SERVER_SOURCE_ROOT` Makefile variable set up correctly, you
can simply say `make run`:

    make run

or

    make RABBIT_SERVER_SOURCE_ROOT=/some/other/path/to/rabbitmq-server run

If this is successful, you should end up with `starting
STOMP-listeners ...done` and `broker running` in your terminal.


## Running tests and code coverage

First, run the adapter as described above:

    make run

Using another console, run tests:

    make test

After successfull run, you should be able to see output similar to:

    python test/test.py
    ............
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 12 tests in 0.300s
    [...]
    {ok, ok}cat cover/summary.txt
     71.73 rabbit_stomp
     74.19 stomp_frame
     72.33 'TOTAL'

The view the code coverage, see html files in ../rabbitmq-server/cover:

    ls ../rabbitmq-server/cover

    rabbit_stomp.html
    stomp_frame.html
    summary.txt



## Running the examples

### Ruby

At this point you can try out the service - for instance, you can run
the Ruby examples if you have Ruby and rubygems handy:

    sudo apt-get install ruby
    sudo apt-get install rubygems
    sudo gem install stomp
    ruby examples/ruby/cb-receiver.rb

and in another window

    ruby examples/ruby/cb-sender.rb

It will transfer 10,000 short messages, and end up displaying

    ...
    Test Message number 9998
    Test Message number 9999
    All Done!

in the receiver-side terminal.


### Perl

    $ sudo cpan -i Net::Stomp

The examples are those from the `Net::Stomp` documentation - run
`perldoc Net::Stomp` to read the originals.

Run the receiver before the sender to make sure the queue exists at
the moment the send takes place. In one terminal window, start the
receiver:

    $ perl examples/perl/rabbitmq_stomp_recv.pl

In another terminal window, run the sender:

    $ perl examples/perl/rabbitmq_stomp_send.pl
    $ perl examples/perl/rabbitmq_stomp_send.pl "hello world"
    $ perl examples/perl/rabbitmq_stomp_send.pl QUIT

The receiver's window should contain the received messages:

    $ perl examples/perl/rabbitmq_stomp_recv.pl 
    test message
    hello
    QUIT
    $
