    <h1>RabbitMQ Management HTTP API</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Apart from this help page, all URIs will serve only resources
    of type <code>application/json</code>, and will require HTTP basic
    authentication (using the standard RabbitMQ user database). The
    default user is guest/guest.</p>

    <p>Many URIs require the name of a virtual host as part of the
    path, since names only uniquely identify objects within a virtual
    host. As the default virtual host is called "<code>/</code>", this
    will need to be encoded as "<code>%2F</code>".</p>

    <p>PUTing a resource creates it. The JSON object you upload must
    have certain mandatory keys (documented below) and may have
    optional keys. Other keys are ignored. Missing mandatory keys
    constitute an error.</p>

    <p>Since bindings do not have names or IDs in AMQP we synthesise
    one based on all its properties. Since predicting this name is
    hard in the general case, you can also create bindings by POSTing
    to a factory URI. See the example below.</p>

    <p>Many URIs return lists. Such URIs can have the query string
    parameters <code>sort</code> and <code>sort_reverse</code>
    added. <code>sort</code> allows you to select a primary field to
    sort by, and <code>sort_reverse</code> will reverse the sort order
    if set to <code>true</code>. The <code>sort</code> parameter can
    contain subfields separated by dots. This allows you to sort by a
    nested component of the listed items; it does not allow you to
    sort by more than one field. See the example below.</p>

    <p>You can also restrict what information is returned per item
    with the <code>columns</code> parameter. This is a comma-separated
    list of subfields separated by dots. See the example below.</p>

    <p>Most of the GET queries return many fields per
    object. See <a href="../doc/stats.html">the separate stats
    documentation</a>.</p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>

    <p>A few quick examples for Windows and Unix, using the command line
    tool <code>curl</code>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Get a list of vhosts:
<pre>:: Windows
C:\&gt; curl -i -u guest:guest http://localhost:15672/api/vhosts

# Unix
$ curl -i -u guest:guest http://localhost:15672/api/vhosts

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 30

[{"name":"/","tracing":false}]
</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        Get a list of channels, fast publishers first, restricting the info
        items we get back:
<pre>:: Windows
C:\&gt; curl -i -u guest:guest "http://localhost:15672/api/channels?sort=message_stats.publish_details.rate&amp;sort_reverse=true&amp;columns=name,message_stats.publish_details.rate,message_stats.deliver_get_details.rate"

# Unix
$ curl -i -u guest:guest 'http://localhost:15672/api/channels?sort=message_stats.publish_details.rate&amp;sort_reverse=true&amp;columns=name,message_stats.publish_details.rate,message_stats.deliver_get_details.rate'

Cache-Control: no-cache

[{"message_stats":{"publish_details":{"rate" <i>... (remainder elided)</i></pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a new vhost:
<pre>:: Windows
C:\&gt; curl -i -u guest:guest -H "content-type:application/json" ^
      -XPUT http://localhost:15672/api/vhosts/foo

# Unix
$ curl -i -u guest:guest -H "content-type:application/json" \
   -XPUT http://localhost:15672/api/vhosts/foo

HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Server: MochiWeb/1.1 WebMachine/1.10.0 (never breaks eye contact)
Date: Mon, 16 Sep 2013 12:03:00 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 0</pre>
        <p>Note: you must specify <code>application/json</code> as the
        mime type.</p>
        <p>Note: the name of the object is not needed in the JSON
          object uploaded, since it is in the URI. As a virtual host
          has no properties apart from its name, this means you do not
          need to specify a body at all!</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a new exchange in the default virtual host:
<pre>:: Windows
C:\&gt; curl -i -u guest:guest -H "content-type:application/json" ^
       -XPUT -d"{""type"":""direct"",""durable"":true}" ^
       http://localhost:15672/api/exchanges/%2F/my-new-exchange

# Unix
$ curl -i -u guest:guest -H "content-type:application/json" \
    -XPUT -d'{"type":"direct","durable":true}' \
    http://localhost:15672/api/exchanges/%2F/my-new-exchange

HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Server: MochiWeb/1.1 WebMachine/1.10.0 (never breaks eye contact)
Date: Mon, 16 Sep 2013 12:04:00 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 0</pre>
        <p>Note: we never return a body in response to a PUT or
        DELETE, unless it fails.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        And delete it again:
<pre>:: Windows
C:\&gt; curl -i -u guest:guest -H "content-type:application/json" ^
       -XDELETE http://localhost:15672/api/exchanges/%2F/my-new-exchange

# Unix
$ curl -i -u guest:guest -H "content-type:application/json" \
    -XDELETE http://localhost:15672/api/exchanges/%2F/my-new-exchange

HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Server: MochiWeb/1.1 WebMachine/1.10.0 (never breaks eye contact)

            Please note that the HTTP API is not ideal for high
            performance publishing; the need to create a new TCP

            throughput compared to AMQP or other protocols using
            long-lived connections.

        <td>
          Get messages from a queue. (This is not an HTTP GET as it
          will alter the state of the queue.) You should post a body looking like:
          <pre>{"count":5,"ackmode":"ack_requeue_true","encoding":"auto","truncate":50000}</pre>
          <ul>
            <li><code>count</code> controls the maximum number of
            messages to get. You may get fewer messages than this if
            the queue cannot immediately provide them.</li>
            <li><code>ackmode</code> determines whether the messages will be
            removed from the queue. If ackmode is ack_requeue_true or reject_requeue_true they will be requeued -
            if ackmode is ack_requeue_false or reject_requeue_false they will be removed.
            <li><code>encoding</code> must be either "auto" (in which case the
            payload will be returned as a string if it is valid UTF-8, and
            base64 encoded otherwise), or "base64" (in which case the payload
            will always be base64 encoded).</li>
            <li>If <code>truncate</code> is present it will truncate the
            message payload if it is larger than the size given (in bytes).</li>
          </ul>
          <p><code>truncate</code> is optional; all other keys are mandatory.</p>
          <p>
            Please note that the get path in the HTTP API is intended
            for diagnostics etc - it does not implement reliable
            delivery and so should be treated as a sysadmin's tool
            rather than a general API for messaging.
