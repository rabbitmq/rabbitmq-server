    <h1>RabbitMQ Management HTTP Stats</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Most of the GET requests you can issue to the HTTP API return
      JSON objects with a large number of keys. While a few of these
      keys represent things you set yourself in a PUT request or AMQP
      command (e.g. queue durability or arguments), most of them
      represent statistics to do with the object in question. This
      page attempts to document them.
    </p>

    <p>
      It should be read in conjunction with the manual page
      for <code>rabbitmqctl</code> (see your installation if on Unix / Linux,
      or <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmqctl.8.html">the
      RabbitMQ website</a> for the latest version). Any field which can
      be returned by a command of the form <code>rabbitmqctl
      list_<i>something</i></code> will also be returned in the
      equivalent part of the HTTP API, so all those keys are not
      documented here. However, the HTTP API also adds a lot of extra
      fields which are not available in <code>rabbitmqctl</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>_details objects</h2>
    <p>
      Many fields represent a count of some kind: queue length,
      messages acknowledged, bytes received and so on. Such absolute
      counts returned by the HTTP API will often have a
      corresponding <code>_details</code> object which offers
      information on how this count has changed. So for example, from
      a queue:
    </p>
<pre>    "messages": 123619,
    "messages_details": {
      "avg": 41206.333333333336,
      "avg_rate": 1030.1583333333333,
      "rate": 24723.8,
      "samples": [
        {
          "sample": 123619,
          "timestamp": 1400680560000
        },
        {
          "sample": 0,
          "timestamp": 1400680500000
        },
        {
          "sample": 0,
          "timestamp": 1400680440000
        }
      ]
    }</pre>

    <p>
      Here we have a <code>messages</code> count (the total messages
      in the queue), with some additional data:
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><code>avg</code></td>
        <td>
          The average value for the requested time period (see below).
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>avg_rate</code></td>
        <td>
          The average rate for the requested time period.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>rate</code></td>
        <td>
          How much the count has changed per second in the most recent
          sampling interval.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>samples</code></td>
        <td>
          Snapshots showing how the value has changed over the
          requested time period.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      <code>avg</code>, <code>avg_rate</code> and <code>samples</code>
      will only appear if you request a specific time period by
      appending query parameters to the URL. To do this you need to
      set an age and an increment for the samples you want. The end of
      the range returned will always correspond to the present.
    </p>

    <p>
      Different types of data take different query parameters to
      return samples, as in the following table. You can specify more
      than one set of parameters if the resource you are requesting
      can generate more than one type of sample (for example, queues
      can return message rates and queue lengths).
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>Messages sent and received</td>
        <td><code>msg_rates_age</code> / <code>msg_rates_incr</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Bytes sent and received</td>
        <td><code>data_rates_age</code> / <code>data_rates_incr</code>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Queue lengths</td>
        <td><code>lengths_age</code> / <code>lengths_incr</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Node statistics (e.g. file descriptors, disk space free)</td>
        <td><code>node_stats_age</code> / <code>node_stats_incr</code></td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      For example,
      appending <code>?lengths_age=3600&lengths_incr=60</code> will
      return the last hour's data on queue lengths, with a sample for
      every minute.
    </p>

    <h2>message_stats objects</h2>
    <p>
      Many objects (including queues, exchanges and channels) will
      return counts of messages passing through them. These are
      included in a <code>message_stats</code> object (which in turn
      will contain <code>_details</code> objects for each count, as
      described above).
    </p>
    <p>
      These can contain:
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><code>publish</code></td>
        <td>
          Count of messages published.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>publish_in</code></td>
        <td>
          Count of messages published "in" to an exchange, i.e. not
          taking account of routing.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>publish_out</code></td>
        <td>
          Count of messages published "out" of an exchange,
          i.e. taking account of routing.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>confirm</code></td>
        <td>
          Count of messages confirmed.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>deliver</code></td>
        <td>
          Count of messages delivered in acknowledgement mode to consumers.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>deliver_no_ack</code></td>
        <td>
          Count of messages delivered in no-acknowledgement mode to consumers.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>get</code></td>
        <td>

      </tr>

        <td><code>deliver_get</code></td>
        <td>
          Sum of all four of the above.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>redeliver</code></td>
        <td>
          Count of subset of messages in <code>deliver_get</code>
          which had the redelivered flag set.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>return_unroutable</code></td>
        <td>
          Count of messages returned to publisher as unroutable.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      Only fields for which some activity has taken place will appear.
    </p>

    <h2>Detailed message stats objects</h2>
    <p>
      In addition, queues, exchanges and channels can return a
      breakdown of message stats for each of their neighbours
      (i.e. adjacent objects in the chain: channel -> exchange ->
      queue -> channel). This will only happen if
      the <code>rates_mode</code> configuration item has been switched
      to <code>detailed</code> from its default of <code>basic</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As this possibly constitutes a large quantity of data, it is also
      only returned when querying a single channel, queue or exchange
      rather than a list. Note also that the default sample retention
      policy means that these detailed message stats do not retain
      historical data for more than a few seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The detailed message stats objects have different names
      depending on where they are (documented below). Each set of
      detailed stats consists of a list of objects with two fields,
      one identifying the partner object and one <code>stats</code>
      which is a message_stats object as described above.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, from a queue:
    </p>
    <pre>  "incoming": [
    {
      "stats": {
        "publish": 352593,
        "publish_details": {
          "rate": 100.2
        }
      },
      "exchange": {
        "name": "my-exchange",
        "vhost": "/"
      }
    }
    {
      "stats": {
        "publish": 543784,
        "publish_details": {
          "rate": 54.6
        }
      },
      "exchange": {
        "name": "amq.topic",
        "vhost": "/"
      }
    }
  ],</pre>

    <p>
      This queue is currently receiving messages from two exchanges:
      100.2 msg/s from "my-exchange" and 54.6 msg/s from "amq.topic".
    </p>
