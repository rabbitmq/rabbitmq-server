## Proposed Changes

Please describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the RabbitMQ team
why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request,
be sure to link to that issue.

A pull request that doesn't explain **why** the change was made has a much lower chance of
being accepted.

If English isn't your first language, don't worry about it and try to communicate the problem
you are trying to solve to the best of your abilities.
As long as we can understand the intent, it's all good.
