%% [0] Currently the only "internal purpose" is federation, but I
%% suspect if we introduce another one it will also be for something
%% that doesn't want to be federated.

%% We need to reconsider whether we need to run or pause every time
%% the consumer state changes in the queue. But why can the state
%% change?
%%
%% consumer blocked   | We may have no more active consumers, and thus need to
%%                    | pause
%%                    |
%% consumer unblocked | We don't care
%%                    |
%% queue empty        | The queue has become empty therefore we need to run to
%%                    | get more messages
%%                    |
%% basic consume      | We don't care
%%                    |
%% basic cancel       | We may have no more active consumers, and thus need to
%%                    | pause
%%                    |
%% refresh            | We asked for it (we have started a new link after
%%                    | failover and need something to prod us into action
%%                    | (or not)).
%%
%% In the cases where we don't care it's not prohibitively expensive
%% for us to be here anyway, so never mind.
%%
%% Note that there is no "queue became non-empty" state change - that's
%% because of the queue invariant. If the queue transitions from empty to
%% non-empty then it must have no active consumers - in which case it stays
%% the same from our POV.
