-module(mnesia_sync).

%% mnesia:sync_transaction/3 fails to guarantee that the log is flushed to disk
%% at commit. This module is an attempt to minimise the risk of data loss by
%% performing a coalesced log fsync. Unfortunately this is performed regardless
%% of whether or not the log was appended to.
