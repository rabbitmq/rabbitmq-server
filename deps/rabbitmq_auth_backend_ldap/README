Overview
========

This plugin provides the ability for your RabbitMQ server to perform
authentication (determining who can log in) and authorisation
(determining what permissions they have) by deferring to an external
LDAP server. To use this plugin, some editing of the RabbitMQ
configuration file is required. You must enable the plugin, and then
configure it. You are advised to read this entire file before
starting.

Requirements
============

You can build and install it like any other plugin (see
http://www.rabbitmq.com/plugin-development.html).

Enabling the plugin
===================

To enable the plugin, set the value of the "auth_backends" configuration item
for the "rabbit" application to include "rabbit_auth_backend_ldap".
"auth_backends" is a list of authentication providers to try in order.

Therefore a complete RabbitMQ configuration that enables this plugin would
look like:

[{rabbit, [{auth_backends, [rabbit_auth_backend_ldap]}]}].

to use only LDAP, or:

[{rabbit,
  [{auth_backends, [rabbit_auth_backend_ldap, rabbit_auth_backend_internal]}]
 }].

to use LDAP and the internal database.

Configuring the plugin
======================

You must then configure the plugin. This plugin has quite a few configuration
options, but most have sensible defaults.

The most complex part of configuring the plugin pertains to
authorisation (i.e. granting permissions to your users via LDAP). This
is documented separately in README-authorisation.

The default configuration allows all users to access all objects in
all vhosts, but does not make them administrators. If you're happy
with that, there is no need to read README-authorisation.

The options not directly related to authorisation are:

servers
-------

Default: ["ldap"]

List of LDAP servers to attempt to bind to, in order. You almost certainly
want to change this.

user_dn_pattern
---------------

Default: "cn=${username},ou=People,dc=example,dc=com"

Pattern for a user's DN. Must contain exactly one instance of
"${username}". This will be where the username supplied by the client
is substituted. You almost certainly want to change this.

other_bind
----------

Default: anon

Normally for authentication this plugin binds to the LDAP server as
the user it is trying to authenticate. This option controls how to
bind for authorisation queries, and to retrieve the details of a user
who is logging in without presenting a password (e.g. SASL EXTERNAL).

This option must either be the atom anon, or a tuple {UserDN, Password}.

use_ssl
-------

Default: false

Whether to use LDAP over SSL. Uses the same SSL configuration as elsewhere in
RabbitMQ.

port
----

Default: 389

Port on which to connect to the LDAP servers.

log
---

Default: false

Set to true to cause LDAP traffic to be written to the RabbitMQ
log. You probably only want to use this for debugging, since it will
usually cause passwords to be written to the logs.

Example configuration file
==========================

A minimal configuration file with some options specified might look
like:

[
  {rabbit, [{auth_backends, [rabbit_auth_backend_ldap]}]},
  {rabbitmq_auth_backend_ldap,
   [ {servers,               ["my-ldap-server"]},
     {user_dn_pattern,       "cn=${username},ou=People,dc=example,dc=com"} ] }
].

Limitations
===========

Currently this plugin is rather chatty with LDAP connections when
doing authorisation over LDAP.

There might need to be more types of queries.

It hasn't received much testing.
