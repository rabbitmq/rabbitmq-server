Overview
========

Authorisation is effected by three configuration options:

* vhost_access_query
* resource_access_query
* is_admin_query

Each defines a query that will determine whether a user has access to
a vhost, a resource (e.g. exchange, queue, binding) or is considered
an administrator.

The default values are {constant, true}, {constant, true} and
{constant, false}, granting all users access to all objects in all
vhosts, but not making them administrators.

A query can be of one of several types:

Constant Query
--------------

{constant, Bool}

This will always return either true or false, unconditionally granting
or denying access.

Exists Query
------------

{exists, Pattern}

This will substitute variables into the pattern, and return true if
there exists an object with the resulting DN *which the user has
permission to read*. Substitution occurs with ${} syntax. The
vhost_access_query in the example configuration below therefore allows
you to control access to vhosts by controlling the read ACLs of OUs in
a vhosts OU.

Each of the three queries allow different substitutions:

vhost_access_query:
  ${username}
  ${vhost}
  ${permission} (read, meaning see it in the management plugin,
                 or write, meaning log in)

resource_access_query:
  ${username}
  ${vhost}
  ${resource} (one of exchange or queue)
  ${name}
  ${permission} (one of configure, write or read)

The terms configure, write and read for resource access have the same
meanings that they do for the built-in RabbitMQ permissions system,
see http://www.rabbitmq.com/admin-guide.html#access-control

is_admin_query:
  ${username}

For Query
---------

{for, [{Name, Value, SubQuery}, ...]}

This allows you to split up a query and handle different cases with
different subqueries.

Options should be a list of three-tuples, with each tuple containing a
name, value and subquery. The name is the name of a variable
(i.e. something that would go into a ${} substitution). The value is a
possible value for that variable.

So the example:

     {resource_access_query,
      {for, [{resource, exchange,
              {for, [{permission, configure, {constant, false}},
                     {permission, write,     {constant, true}},
                     {permission, read,      {constant, true}}
                    ]}},
             {resource, queue, {constant, true}} ]}}

would allow all users to do anything but declare and delete exchanges.

Example Configuration
=====================

TODO improve and explain this

[
  {rabbit, [{auth_backends, [rabbit_auth_backend_ldap]}]},
  {rabbit_auth_backend_ldap,
   [ {servers,               ["my-ldap-server"]},
     {user_dn_pattern,       "cn=${username},ou=People,dc=example,dc=com"},
     {vhost_access_query,    {exists,
                              "ou=${vhost},ou=vhosts,dc=example,dc=com"}},
     {resource_access_query,
      {for, [{resource, exchange,
              {for, [{permission, configure, {constant, false}},
                     {permission, write,     {constant, true}},
                     {permission, read,      {constant, true}}
                    ]}},
             {resource, queue, {constant, true}} ]}},
     {is_admin_query,        {constant, false}},
     {use_ssl,               false},
     {port,                  389},
     {log,                   false} ] }
].
