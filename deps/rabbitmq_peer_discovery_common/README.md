# RabbitMQ Peer Discovery Commons

This library is similar in purpose to [rabbit-common](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-common) but focusses exclusively
on [RabbitMQ peer discovery backends](http://www.rabbitmq.com/cluster-formation.html) (available as [a plugin](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-autocluster) for 3.6.x releases).

It is not supposed to be enabled, disabled or used directly by the users, only as a
dependency of other plugins.


## Project Maturity

This library [shipped with RabbitMQ 3.7.0](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.7.0).


## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and our [development process overview](http://www.rabbitmq.com/github.html).
