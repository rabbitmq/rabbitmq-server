  DEPRECATED: this command does nothing in RabbitMQ 4.0 and newer.

  Exits with a non-zero code if there are classic mirrored queues that don't
  have any in sync mirrors online and would potentially lose data
  if the target node is shut down.

  This command is meant to be used as a pre-upgrade (pre-shutdown) check.
