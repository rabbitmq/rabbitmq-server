## RabbitMQ

All metrics are in alphabetical order.

### Global Counters

These were introduced to address an inherent flaw with existing counters when
metrics are aggregated (default behaviour). When connections or channels
terminate, their metrics get garbage collected (meaning that they disappear
after a while). All counters that aggregate metrics across connections and
channels decrease, since the sum is now lower, and that in turn results rate &
irate functions in Prometheus returning nonsensical values (e.g. 4Mil msg/s).
This problem is made worse by Streams, since those values **may** be real, but
we can't trust them, which is the worst place to be in. The Global counters fix
this, and also introduce per-protocol as well as per-protocol AND queue type
metrics, which is something that many of you have requested for a while now.

<!--
To generate these:
  1. From within the rabbitmq-server repository, run the following command:
     make run-broker
  2. In vim, position the cursor where you want the metrics importing, then run:
     r !curl -s localhost:15692/metrics | grep 'HELP rabbitmq_global_'
  3. Also in vim, select all formatted lines and run:
     sort
  4. Still in vim, build & run a macro re-formats all other metrics
  5. Lastly, visual select all lines in vim and run the following command:
     Tabularize /|

Metrics `rabbitmq_global_messages_dead_lettered_*` have labels `queue_type` and `dead_letter_strategy`.

Label `queue_type` denotes the type of queue messages were discarded from. It can have value
* `rabbit_classic_queue`,
* `rabbit_quorum_queue`, or
* `rabbit_mqtt_qos0_queue`

(Queue type `rabbit_stream_queue` does not dead letter messages.)

Note that metrics `rabbitmq_global_messages_dead_lettered_*` with label `queue_type` set to `rabbit_quorum_queue`
might miss some counter updates in certain failure scenarios, i.e. the reported Prometheus value could be
slightly lower than the actual number of messages dead lettered (and confirmed).
(This is because in the current implementation quorum queue leaders update the counters asynchronously.)

Label `dead_letter_strategy` can have value
* `disabled` if queue has no dead-letter-exchange configured or if configured dead-letter-exchange does not exist implying messages get dropped, or
* `at_most_once` if queue's configured dead-lettered-exchange exists, or
* `at_least_once` if queue type is `rabbit_quorum_queue` with configured `dead-letter-exchange` and `dead-letter-strategy` set to `at-least-once` and `overflow` set to `reject-publish`.

#### Stream global counters

These metrics are specific to the stream protocol.
