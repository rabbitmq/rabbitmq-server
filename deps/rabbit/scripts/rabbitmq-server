    # of this script) gets precedence over signal handling. Therefore,
    # when `wait` is interrupted, its exit code is non-zero and because
    # of `set -e`, the script terminates immediately without running the
    # signal handler. To work around this issue, we use "|| true" to
    # force that statement to succeed and the signal handler to properly
    # execute. Because the statement below has an exit code of 0, the
    # signal handler has to restate the expected exit code.
