.Sh DESCRIPTION
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RabbitMQ is an open source multi-protocol messaging broker.
.Pp
.Nm
is the main command line tool for managing a RabbitMQ server node,
together with
.Cm rabbitmq-diagnostics
,
.Cm rabbitmq-upgrade
, and others.
.Pp
It performs all actions by connecting to the target RabbitMQ node
on a dedicated CLI tool communication port and authenticating
using a shared secret (known as the cookie file).
.Pp
Diagnostic information is displayed if connection failed,
the target node was not running, or
.Nm
could not authenticate to
the target node successfully.

.Lk https://www.rabbitmq.com/cli.html "RabbitMQ CLI Tools guide"
and
.Lk https://www.rabbitmq.com/networking.html "RabbitMQ Networking guide"
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh OPTIONS
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl n Ar node
Default node is
.Qq Ar rabbit@target-hostname ,
where
.Ar target-hostname
is the local host.
On a host named
.Qq myserver.example.com ,
the node name will usually be
.Qq rabbit@myserver
(unless
.Ev RABBITMQ_NODENAME
has been overridden).
The output of
.Qq hostname -s
is usually the correct suffix to use after the
.Qq @
sign.
See
.Xr rabbitmq-server 8
for details of configuring a RabbitMQ node.
.It Fl q , -quiet
Quiet output mode is selected.
Informational messages are reduced when quiet mode is in effect.
.It Fl s , -silent
Silent output mode is selected.
Informational messages are reduced and table headers are suppressed when silent mode is in effect.
.It Fl -no-table-headers
Do not output headers for tabular data.
.It Fl -dry-run
Do not run the command.
Only print information message.
.It Fl t Ar timeout , Fl -timeout Ar timeout
Operation timeout in seconds.
Not all commands support timeouts.
Default is
.Cm infinity .
.It Fl l , Fl -longnames
Must be specified when the cluster is configured to use long (FQDN) node names.
To learn more, see the
.Lk https://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html "RabbitMQ Clustering guide"
.It Fl -erlang-cookie Ar cookie
Shared secret to use to authenticate to the target node.
Prefer using a local file or the
.Ev RABBITMQ_ERLANG_COOKIE
environment variable instead of specifying this option on the command line.

.\" ## Nodes
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------
.Ss Nodes
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------
.It Cm await_startup
.Pp
Waits for the RabbitMQ application to start on the target node
.Pp
For example, to wait for the RabbitMQ application to start:
.sp
.Dl rabbitmqctl await_startup
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------
.It Cm reset
.Pp
Returns a RabbitMQ node to its virgin state.
.Pp
Removes the node from any cluster it belongs to, removes all data from
the management database, such as configured users and vhosts, and
deletes all persistent messages.
.Pp
For
.Cm reset
and
.Cm force_reset
to succeed the RabbitMQ application must have been stopped, e.g. with
.Cm stop_app .
.Pp
For example, to reset the RabbitMQ node:
.sp
.Dl rabbitmqctl reset
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------
.It Cm rotate_logs
.Pp
Instructs the RabbitMQ node to perform internal log rotation.
.Pp
Log rotation is performed according to the logging settings specified in the configuration file.
The rotation operation is asynchronous, there is no guarantee that it has completed when this command returns.
.Pp
Note that there is no need to call this command in case of external log rotation (e.g. from logrotate(8)).
.Pp
For example, to initial log rotation:
.sp
.Dl rabbitmqctl rotate_logs
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------
.It Cm shutdown
.Pp
Shuts down the node, both RabbitMQ and its runtime.
The command is blocking and will return after the runtime process exits.
If RabbitMQ fails to stop, it will return a non-zero exit code.
This command infers the OS PID of the target node and
therefore can only be used to shut down nodes running on the same
host (or broadly speaking, in the same operating system,
e.g. in the same VM or container)
.Pp
Unlike the stop command, the shutdown command:
.Bl -bullet
.It
does not require a
.Ar pid_file
to wait for the runtime process to exit
.It
returns a non-zero exit code if RabbitMQ node is not running
.El
.Pp
For example, this will shut down a locally running RabbitMQ node
with default node name:
.sp
.Dl rabbitmqctl shutdown
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------
.It Cm start_app
.Pp
Starts the RabbitMQ application.
.Pp
This command is typically run after performing other management actions
that required the RabbitMQ application to be stopped, e.g.\&
.Cm reset .
.Pp
For example, to instruct the RabbitMQ node to start the RabbitMQ
application:
.sp
.Dl rabbitmqctl start_app
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------
.It Cm stop Op Ar pid_file
.Pp
Stops the Erlang node on which RabbitMQ is running.
To restart the node follow the instructions for
.Qq Running the Server
in the
.Lk https://rabbitmq.com/download.html installation guide .
.Pp
If a
.Ar pid_file
is specified, also waits for the process specified there to terminate.
See the description of the
.Cm wait
command for details on this file.
.Pp
For example, to instruct the RabbitMQ node to terminate:
.sp
.Dl rabbitmqctl stop
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------
.It Cm stop_app
.Pp
Stops the RabbitMQ application, leaving the runtime (Erlang VM) running.
.Pp
This command is typically run prior to performing other management
actions that require the RabbitMQ application to be stopped, e.g.\&
.Cm reset .
.Pp
For example, to instruct the RabbitMQ node to stop the RabbitMQ
application:
.sp
.Dl rabbitmqctl stop_app
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------
.It Cm wait Ar pid_file , Cm wait Fl -pid Ar pid
.Pp
Waits for the RabbitMQ application to start.
.Pp
This command will wait for the RabbitMQ application to start at the
node.
It will wait for the pid file to be created if
.Ar pidfile
is specified, then for a process with a pid specified in the pid file or
the
.Fl -pid
argument, and then for the RabbitMQ application to start in that process.
It will fail if the process terminates without starting the RabbitMQ
application.
.Pp
If the specified pidfile is not created or erlang node is not started within
.Fl -timeout
the command will fail.
Default timeout is 10 seconds.
.Pp
A suitable pid file is created by the
.Xr rabbitmq-server 8
script.
By default this is located in the Mnesia directory.
Modify the
.Ev RABBITMQ_PID_FILE
environment variable to change the location.
.Pp
For example, this command will return when the RabbitMQ node has started
up:
.sp
.Dl rabbitmqctl wait /var/run/rabbitmq/pid
.El
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------
.\" ## Cluster Operations
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------
.Ss Cluster management
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------
.It Cm await_online_nodes Ar count
.Pp
Waits for
.Ar count
nodes to join the cluster
.Pp
For example, to wait for two RabbitMQ nodes to start:
.sp
.Dl rabbitmqctl await_online_nodes 2
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------
.It Cm change_cluster_node_type Ar type
.Pp
Changes the type of the cluster node.
.Pp
The
.Ar type
must be one of the following:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
.Cm disc
.It
.Cm ram
.El
.Pp
The node must be stopped for this operation to succeed, and when turning
a node into a RAM node the node must not be the only disc node in the
cluster.
.Pp
For example, this command will turn a RAM node into a disc node:
.sp
.Dl rabbitmqctl change_cluster_node_type disc
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------
.It Cm cluster_status
.Pp
Displays all the nodes in the cluster grouped by node type, together
with the currently running nodes.
.Pp
For example, this command displays the nodes in the cluster:
.sp
.Dl rabbitmqctl cluster_status
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------
.It Cm force_boot
.Pp
Ensures that the node will start next time, even if it was not the last
to shut down.
.Pp
Normally when you shut down a RabbitMQ cluster altogether, the first
node you restart should be the last one to go down, since it may have
seen things happen that other nodes did not.
But sometimes that's not possible: for instance if the entire cluster
loses power then all nodes may think they were not the last to shut
down.
.Pp
In such a case you can invoke
.Cm force_boot
while the node is down.
This will tell the node to unconditionally start next time you ask it
to.
If any changes happened to the cluster after this node shut down, they
will be lost.
.Pp
If the last node to go down is permanently lost then you should use
.Cm forget_cluster_node Fl -offline
in preference to this command, as it will ensure that mirrored queues
which had their leader replica on the lost node get promoted.
.Pp
For example, this will force the node not to wait for other nodes next
time it is started:
.sp
.Dl rabbitmqctl force_boot
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------
.It Cm force_reset
.Pp
Forcefully returns a RabbitMQ node to its virgin state.
.Pp
The
.Cm force_reset
command differs from
.Cm reset
in that it resets the node unconditionally, regardless of the current
management database state and cluster configuration.
It should only be used as a last resort if the database or cluster
configuration has been corrupted.
.Pp
For
.Cm reset
and
.Cm force_reset
to succeed the RabbitMQ application must have been stopped, e.g. with
.Cm stop_app .
.Pp
For example, to reset the RabbitMQ node:
.sp
.Dl rabbitmqctl force_reset
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------
.It Cm forget_cluster_node Op Fl -offline
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl -offline
Enables node removal from an offline node.
This is only useful in the situation where all the nodes are offline and
the last node to go down cannot be brought online, thus preventing the
whole cluster from starting.
It should not be used in any other circumstances since it can lead to
inconsistencies.
.El
.Pp
Removes a cluster node remotely.
The node that is being removed must be offline, while the node we are
removing from must be online, except when using the
.Fl -offline
flag.
.Pp
When using the
.Fl -offline
flag ,
.Nm
will not attempt to connect to a node as normal; instead it will
temporarily become the node in order to make the change.
This is useful if the node cannot be started normally.
In this case the node will become the canonical source for cluster
metadata (e.g. which queues exist), even if it was not before.
Therefore you should use this command on the latest node to shut down if
at all possible.
.Pp
For example, this command will remove the node
.Qq rabbit@stringer
from the node
.Qq hare@mcnulty :
.sp
.Dl rabbitmqctl -n hare@mcnulty forget_cluster_node rabbit@stringer
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------
.It Cm join_cluster Ar seed-node Op Fl -ram
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ar seed-node
Existing cluster member (seed node) to cluster with.
.It Fl -ram
If provided, the node will join the cluster as a RAM node.
RAM node use is discouraged. Use only if you understand why
exactly you need to use them.
.El
.Pp
Instructs the node to become a member of the cluster that the specified
node is in.
Before clustering, the node is reset, so be careful when using this
command.
For this command to succeed the RabbitMQ application must have been
stopped, e.g. with
.Cm stop_app .
.Pp
Cluster nodes can be of two types: disc or RAM.
Disc nodes replicate data in RAM and on disc, thus providing redundancy
in the event of node failure and recovery from global events such as
power failure across all nodes.
RAM nodes replicate data in RAM only (with the exception of queue
contents, which can reside on disc if the queue is persistent or too big
to fit in memory) and are mainly used for scalability.
RAM nodes are more performant only when managing resources (e.g.\&
adding/removing queues, exchanges, or bindings).
A cluster must always have at least one disc node, and usually should
have more than one.
.Pp
The node will be a disc node by default.
If you wish to create a RAM node, provide the
.Fl -ram
flag.
.Pp
After executing the
.Cm join_cluster
command, whenever the RabbitMQ application is started on the current
node it will attempt to connect to the nodes that were in the cluster
when the node went down.
.Pp
To leave a cluster,
.Cm reset
the node.
You can also remove nodes remotely with the
.Cm forget_cluster_node
command.
.Pp
For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ node to join the cluster that
.Qq hare@elena
is part of, as a ram node:
.sp
.Dl rabbitmqctl join_cluster hare@elena --ram
.Pp

.Lk https://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html "RabbitMQ Clustering guide".
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------
.It Cm rename_cluster_node Ar oldnode1 Ar newnode1 Op Ar oldnode2 Ar newnode2 ...
.Pp
Supports renaming of cluster nodes in the local database.
.Pp
This subcommand causes
.Nm
to temporarily become the node in order to make the change.
The local cluster node must therefore be completely stopped; other nodes
can be online or offline.
.Pp
This subcommand takes an even number of arguments, in pairs representing
the old and new names for nodes.
You must specify the old and new names for this node and for any other
nodes that are stopped and being renamed at the same time.
.Pp
It is possible to stop all nodes and rename them all simultaneously (in
which case old and new names for all nodes must be given to every node)
or stop and rename nodes one at a time (in which case each node only
needs to be told how its own name is changing).
.Pp
For example, this command will rename the node
.Qq rabbit@misshelpful
to the node
.Qq rabbit@cordelia
.sp
.Dl rabbitmqctl rename_cluster_node rabbit@misshelpful rabbit@cordelia
.Pp
Note that this command only changes the local database.
It may also be necessary to rename the local database directories,
and to configure the new node name.
For example:
.sp
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
Stop the node:
.sp
.Dl rabbitmqctl stop rabbit@misshelpful
.sp
.It
Rename the node in the local database:
.sp
.Dl rabbitmqctl rename_cluster_node rabbit@misshelpful rabbit@cordelia
.sp
.It
Rename the local database directories (note, you do not need to do this
if you have set the RABBITMQ_MNESIA_DIR environment variable):
.sp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
mv \\
  /var/lib/rabbitmq/mnesia/rabbit\\@misshelpful \\
  /var/lib/rabbitmq/mnesia/rabbit\\@cordelia
mv \\
  /var/lib/rabbitmq/mnesia/rabbit\\@misshelpful-rename \\
  /var/lib/rabbitmq/mnesia/rabbit\\@cordelia-rename
mv \\

.El
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------
.It Cm update_cluster_nodes Ar clusternode
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ar clusternode
The node to consult for up-to-date information.
.El
.Pp
Instructs an already clustered node to contact
.Ar clusternode
to cluster when booting up.
This is different from
.Cm join_cluster
since it does not join any cluster - it checks that the node is already
in a cluster with
.Ar clusternode .
.Pp
The need for this command is motivated by the fact that clusters can
change while a node is offline.
Consider a situation where node
.Va rabbit@A
and
.Va rabbit@B
are clustered.
.Va rabbit@A
goes down,
.Va rabbit@C
clusters with
.Va rabbit@B ,
and then
.Va rabbit@B
leaves the cluster.
When
.Va rabbit@A
starts back up, it'll try to contact
.Va rabbit@B ,
but this will fail since
.Va rabbit@B
is not in the cluster anymore.
The following command will rename node
.Va rabbit@B
to
.Va rabbit@C
on node
.Va rabbitA
.sp
.Dl update_cluster_nodes -n Va rabbit@A Va rabbit@B Va rabbit@C

The name of the queue to synchronise.
.El
.Pp
Instructs a mirrored queue with unsynchronised mirrors (follower replicas)
to synchronise them.
The queue will block while synchronisation takes place (all publishers
to and consumers using the queue will block or temporarily see no activity).
This command can only be used with mirrored queues.
To learn more, see the
.Lk https://www.rabbitmq.com/ha.html "RabbitMQ Mirroring guide"
.Pp
Note that queues with unsynchronised replicas and active consumers
will become synchronised eventually (assuming that consumers make progress).
This command is primarily useful for queues which do not have active consumers.

.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------
.It Cm list_users
.Pp
Lists users.
Each result row will contain the user name followed by a list of the
tags set for that user.
.Pp
For example, this command instructs the RabbitMQ broker to list all users:
.sp
.Dl rabbitmqctl list_users
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------
.It Cm set_user_tags Ar username Op Ar tag ...

.\" ## Runtime Parameters and Policies
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------
.Ss Runtime Parameters and Policies
Certain features of RabbitMQ (such as the Federation plugin) are
controlled by dynamic, cluster-wide
.Em parameters.
There are 2 kinds of parameters: parameters scoped to a virtual host and
global parameters.
Each vhost-scoped parameter consists of a component name, a name and a
value.
The component name and name are strings, and the value is a valid JSON document.
A global parameter consists of a name and value.
The name is a string and the value is an arbitrary Erlang data structure.
Parameters can be set, cleared and listed.
In general you should refer to the documentation for the feature in
question to see how to set parameters.
.Pp
Policies is a feature built on top of runtime parameters.
Policies are used to control and modify the behaviour of queues and
exchanges on a cluster-wide basis.
Policies apply within a given vhost, and consist of a name, pattern,
definition and an optional priority.
Policies can be set, cleared and listed.
