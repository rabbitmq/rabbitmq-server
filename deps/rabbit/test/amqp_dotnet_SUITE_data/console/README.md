# Console application to test AMQP 1.0

This is a basic .NetCore console application which uses *AMQP 1.0* .Net **AMQPNetLite** client library.

Usage:
```
dotnet run
```

It sends 10 messages and it waits for key-stroke to terminate which is very convenient
when we need to create AMQP 1.0 connections.
