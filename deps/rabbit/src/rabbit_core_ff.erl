%% We bundle the following separate concerns (which could have been separate feature flags)
%% into a single feature flag for better user experience:
%% 1. credit API v2 between classic / quorum queue client and classic / quorum queue server
%% 2. cancel API v2 betweeen classic queue client and classic queue server
%% 3. more compact quorum queue commands in quorum queue v4
%% 4. store messages in message containers AMQP 1.0 disk format v1
%% 5. support queue leader locator in classic queues
