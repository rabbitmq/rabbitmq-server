-module(rabbit_channel_tracking_handler).

%% This module keeps track of channel creation and termination events
%% on its local node. Similar to the rabbit_connection_tracking_handler,
%% the primary goal here is to decouple channel tracking from rabbit_reader
%% and isolate channel tracking to its own process to avoid blocking connection
%% creation events. Additionaly, creation events are also non-blocking in that
%% they spawn a short-live process for updating the tracking tables in realtime.
%%
%% Events from other nodes are ignored.
