Thank you for using RabbitMQ.

**STOP NOW AND READ THIS** BEFORE OPENING A NEW ISSUE ON GITHUB

Unless you are CERTAIN you have found a reproducible problem in RabbitMQ
or have a **specific, actionable** suggestion for our team, you must
first ask your question or discuss your suspected issue on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rabbitmq-users). Team RabbitMQ does not use GitHub issues
for discussions, investigations, root cause analysis and so on.

Please take the time to read the `CONTRIBUTING.md` document for instructions on [how
to effectively ask a question or report a suspected issue](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#github-issues) on the mailing list.

Following these rules **will save time** to both your and the maintainers.

Thank you.
