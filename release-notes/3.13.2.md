## RabbitMQ 3.13.2

RabbitMQ `3.13.2` is a maintenance release in the `3.13.x` [release series](https://www.rabbitmq.com/release-information).
This series [is covered](https://www.rabbitmq.com/release-information) by community support through Feb 28, 2025 and extended commercial support through Aug 31, 2025.

Please refer to the upgrade section from the [3.13.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.13.0)
if upgrading from a version prior to 3.13.0.

This release requires Erlang 26 and supports Erlang versions up to `26.2.x`.
[RabbitMQ and Erlang/OTP Compatibility Matrix](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/which-erlang) has more details on
Erlang version requirements for RabbitMQ.


### Minimum Supported Erlang Version

As of 3.13.0, RabbitMQ requires Erlang 26. Nodes **will fail to start** on older Erlang releases.

Users upgrading from 3.12.x (or older releases) on Erlang 25 to 3.13.x on Erlang 26
(both RabbitMQ *and* Erlang are upgraded at the same time) **must** consult
the [v3.12.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.12.0) and [v3.13.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.13.0) first.

#### Enhancements

 * When a virtual host is deleted, several more [internal events](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/logging#internal-events) are emitted: for example,
   the events related to removal of user permissions and runtime parameters associated
   with the virtual host.

   GitHub issue: [#11077](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/11077)

   an exception due to an unnecessary permission check on the will target.

   GitHub issue: [#11024](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/11024)

 * Messages published by MQTT clients were missing the `timestamp_in_ms` (the more precise header).
   This behavior was new in 3.13.x.

   GitHub issue: [#10925](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/10925)

 * Messages published using QoS 0 were unintentionally marked as durable internally.

   GitHub issue: [#11012](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/11012)


### Management Plugin

#### Bug Fixes

 * `GET /api/queues/{vhost}/{name}` could return duplicate keys for quorum queues.

   GitHub issue: [#10929](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/10929)

 * Several endpoints responded with a 500 instead of a 404 when target virtual host
   was non-existent.

### Kubernetes Peer Discovery Plugin

#### Enhancements

   cluster_formation.k8s.tls.certfile = /path/to/client/tls/certificate.pem
   cluster_formation.k8s.tls.keyfile = /path/to/client/tls/private_key.pem
