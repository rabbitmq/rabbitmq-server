### Core Server

#### Bug Fixes

#### Enhancements

 * Several inter-node communication listener settings are now exposed to `rabbitmq.conf`:

   ``` ini
   # this port range is used by default
   distribution.listener.port_range.min = 25675
   distribution.listener.port_range.max = 25675
   # instead of listening on all interfaces
   distribution.listener.interface = 192.168.0.1
   ```
