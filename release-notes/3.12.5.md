RabbitMQ `3.12.5` is a maintenance release in the `3.12.x` [release series](https://www.rabbitmq.com/versions.html).

Please refer to the upgrade section from the [3.12.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.12.0)
if upgrading from a version prior to 3.12.0.

This release requires Erlang 25 and supports Erlang versions up to `26.0.x`.
[RabbitMQ and Erlang/OTP Compatibility Matrix](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) has more details on
Erlang version requirements for RabbitMQ.


### Minimum Supported Erlang Version

As of 3.12.0, RabbitMQ requires Erlang 25. Nodes **will fail to start** on older Erlang releases.

Users upgrading from 3.11.x (or older releases) on Erlang 25 to 3.12.x on Erlang 26
(both RabbitMQ *and* Erlang are upgraded at the same time) **must** consult
the [v3.12.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.12.0) first.


## Changes Worth Mentioning

Release notes can be found on GitHub at [rabbitmq-server/release-notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/tree/v3.12.x/release-notes).


### Core Server

#### Bug Fixes

 * Quorum queue leader changes are now correctly observed in certain network failure scenarios.

   GitHub issues: [#9241](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/9241), [#9227](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/9227)

 * High consumer churn with reused consumer tag on quorum queues could result in some messages not being delivered
   after a period of time.

   This did not affect environments where consumer churn does not exist or where it does but consumer tags vary.

   GitHub issue: [#9158](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/9158)

 * Three environment variables, `LOG_BASE`, `MNESIA_BASE`, `CONFIG_FILE`, were not picked up when set in
   `rabbitmq-env-conf.bat` on Windows.

   Gi9158issue: [#9307](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/9307)

 * Avoids a potential exception when autoheal partition handling process was initiated.

   GitHub issue: [#9222](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/9222)


### MQTT Plugin

#### Bug Fixes

 * If a socket write fails, close the connection quickly to avoid producing a lot of
   log noise.

   GitHub issue: [#9281](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/9281)
