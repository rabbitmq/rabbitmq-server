RabbitMQ `3.9.4` is a maintenance release in the `3.9.x` release series.

Please refer to the **Upgrading to 3.9** section from [v3.9.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.9.0) if upgrading from a version prior to 3.9.0.

This release requires at least Erlang 23.2, and supports the latest Erlang 24 version, 24.0.5 at the time of release. [RabbitMQ and Erlang/OTP Compatibility Matrix](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) has more details on Erlang version requirements for RabbitMQ.

### Core Server

#### Enhancements

 * New Prometheus metrics for alarms:
   * `rabbitmq_alarms_file_descriptor_limit` 1|0
   * `rabbitmq_alarms_free_disk_space_watermark` 1|0
   * `rabbitmq_alarms_memory_used_watermark` 1|0
   
   While some of the alarms have cluster-wide effect, these metrics are node-local.

   GitHub issue: [#2653](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/2653)

 * Nodes will now use four more environment variables, if set: `RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER` (overrides `default_user` in `rabbitmq.conf`), `RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS` (overrides `default_pass`), `RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_VHOST` (overrides `default_vhost`) and `RABBITMQ_ERLANG_COOKIE` (sets [shared authentication secret value](https://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html#erlang-cookie)).
   These variables **are not recommended to be used in production** but can be the only realistic option in some environment, such as service containers, ECS, and so on.
   Most users should continue using `rabbitmq.conf` and a securely generated local cookie file.
