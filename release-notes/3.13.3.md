## RabbitMQ 3.13.3

RabbitMQ `3.13.3` is a maintenance release in the `3.13.x` [release series](https://www.rabbitmq.com/release-information).

Starting June 1st, 2024, community support for this series will only be provided to [regularly contributing users](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/main/COMMUNITY_SUPPORT.md) and those
who hold a valid [commercial support license](https://tanzu.vmware.com/rabbitmq/oss).

Please refer to the upgrade section from the [3.13.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.13.0)
if upgrading from a version prior to 3.13.0.

This release requires Erlang 26 and supports Erlang versions up to `26.2.x`.
[RabbitMQ and Erlang/OTP Compatibility Matrix](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/which-erlang) has more details on
Erlang version requirements for RabbitMQ.


### Minimum Supported Erlang Version

As of 3.13.0, RabbitMQ requires Erlang 26. Nodes **will fail to start** on older Erlang releases.

Users upgrading from 3.12.x (or older releases) on Erlang 25 to 3.13.x on Erlang 26
(both RabbitMQ *and* Erlang are upgraded at the same time) **must** consult
the [v3.12.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.12.0) and [v3.13.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.13.0) first.

### Core Broker

#### Bug Fixes

 * Fixes an exception in classic queue message store that produced large scary looking log entries.
   No data was lost as a result of the exception but clients could run into a channel error.

   GitHub issue: [#11292](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/11292)

 * Corrected several 3.13-specific issues related to how the `x-death` headers are populated during [dead lettering](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/dlx).

   GitHub issues: [#11160](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/11160), [#11159](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/11159), [#11174](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/11174)

 * Per-virtual host queue (and stream) limit is now enforced for AMQP 1.0, MQTT, RabbitMQ Stream Protocol and STOMP as well as AMQP 0-9-1.

   Contributed by @SimonUnge.

   GitHub issue: [#11293](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/11293)

 * Periodic replica reconciliation of quorum queues now reacts to node shutdown in cluster where Khepri is enabled.

   Contributed by @SimonUnge.

   GitHub issue: [#11134](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/11134)

 * Declaration of an exchange of a non-existent type will now report a more suitable "precondition failed"
   error to the client.

   Contributed by @carlhoerberg.

   GitHub issue: [#11215](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/11215)

 * Avoids a scary looking log message during node shutdown in certain plugin configurations.

   GitHub issue: [#11323](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/11323)

#### Enhancements

 * `x-death` headers used to provide metadata about [dead-lettering](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/dlx) are now included
   for messages consumed from a stream.

   GitHub issue: [#11173](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/11173)

 * Optimised classic queue message store recovery in cases where a message was routed
   to multiple queues.

   Contributed by @gomoripeti.

   GitHub issue: [#11072](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/11072)

 * Besides the previously existing option of configuring default queue type per virtual host,
   there is now a "global" per node default that can be set via `rabbitmq.conf`:

   ``` ini
   # Changes default queue type for all clients connected to the configured node
   # to quorum queues.
   # This is just an example, not all queues should be quorum queues.
   # See https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/quorum-queues to learn more.
   default_queue_type = quorum
   ```

   Contributed by @SimonUnge.

   GitHub issue: [#11163](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/11163)

 * When a virtual host process stops, fails or is restarted, a clear message will now be logged.

   GitHub issue: [#11276](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/11276)



### CLI Tools

#### Bug Fixes

 * `rabbitmq-plugins list` incorrectly marked disabled plugins as "pending an upgrade".

   Partially contributed by @gomoripeti.

   GitHub issue: [#11198](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/11198)

 * `rabbitmqctl check_if_any_deprecated_features_are_used` could run into an exception.

   Partially contributed by @metron2.

   GitHub issue: [#11194](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/11194)


### Prometheus Plugin

#### Enhancements

 * A new Prometheus-exposed metric, `rabbit_stream_segments`, indicates how many stream segment files
   there are on a node.

   Contributed by @markus812498.

   GitHub issue: [#11325](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/11325)


### Management Plugin

#### Bug Fixes

 * After signing out of management UI, the page was not refreshed to reflect updated login (session) status.

   GitHub issue: [#11224](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/11224)


### Shovel Management Plugin

#### Bug Fixes

 * `fail_if_no_peer_cert`, a server-side TLS setting, was removed from Shovel URI examples.
    Erlang 26's TLS implementation will refuse to accept it as a client-side setting whereas
    previously it was quietly ignored.

   Contributed by @womblep.

   GitHub issue: [#11318](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/11318)
