## RabbitMQ 4.1.8

RabbitMQ `4.1.8` is a maintenance release in the `4.1.x` [release series](https://www.rabbitmq.com/release-information).

It is **strongly recommended** that you read [4.1.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v4.1.0)
in detail if upgrading from a version prior to `4.1.0`.


### Minimum Supported Erlang Version

[RabbitMQ and Erlang/OTP Compatibility Matrix](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/which-erlang) has more details on Erlang version requirements for RabbitMQ.

Nodes **will fail to start** on older Erlang releases.


## Changes Worth Mentioning

Release notes can be found on GitHub at [rabbitmq-server/release-notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/tree/v4.1.x/release-notes).

### Core Server

#### Bug Fixes

 * Classic queue recovery on Windows could fail due to an OS-specific file locking behavior.
   Such failures are now retried in two more contexts.

   GitHub issue: [#15136](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/15136)

 * `mirrored_supervisor:child/2` could fail with a `badmatch` exception
   when a significant enough number of shovels (or federation links) was removed.

   GitHub issue: [#15229](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/15229)


### Federation Plugins

#### Bug Fixes

 * Restored exchange federation compatibility in mixed 4.2.x/4.1.x multi-node clusters.

   GitHub issue: [#15252](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/15252)

#### Enhancements

 * Federation links and their connections are now stopped in parallel.

   This significantly improves shutdown time for nodes with many (into thousands) federation links.

   GitHub issue: [#15271](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/15271)

 * Federation links no longer restart during plugin or node shutdown.

   For nodes with hundreds or thousands of federation links, link recovery could
   significantly delay node shutdown.

   GitHub issue: [#15258](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/15258)

 * Federation links use AMQP 0-9-1 connections to remote nodes (clusters).

   Previously the timeout used when those connections are closed was fixed to 10 seconds.
   Now it is configurable via `rabbitmq.conf` in milliseconds:

   ```ini
   # 3 seconds for exchange federation
   federation.exchanges.connection_close_timeout = 3000

   # 3 seconds for queue federation
   federation.queues.connection_close_timeout = 3000
   ```

   The maximum supported value is 5 seconds (5000 ms).

   GitHub issue: [#15268](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/15268)


### MQTT Plugin

#### Enhancements

 * A new configuration option, `mqtt.disconnect_on_unauthorized`, controls whether
   MQTT connections are closed upon authorization failures (for example, an attempt to
   consume from a topic the client has no permission for).

   When set to `false`, the connection remains open and an appropriate protocol-level
   response is sent to the client instead.

   The default value is `true`, same as RabbitMQ MQTT implementation's historic behavior.

   GitHub issue: [#15201](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/15201)
