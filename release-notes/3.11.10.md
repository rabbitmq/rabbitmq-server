RabbitMQ `3.11.10` is a maintenance release in the `3.11.x` [release series](https://www.rabbitmq.com/versions.html).

Please refer to the upgrade section from [v3.11.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.11.0)
if upgrading from a version prior to 3.11.0.

This release requires Erlang 25.
[RabbitMQ and Erlang/OTP Compatibility Matrix](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) has more details on
Erlang version requirements for RabbitMQ.


### Minimum Supported Erlang Version

As of 3.11.0, RabbitMQ requires Erlang 25. Nodes **will fail to start** on older Erlang releases.

Erlang 25 as our new baseline means much improved performance on ARM64 architectures, [profiling with flame graphs](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2022/05/flame-graphs/)
across all architectures, and the most recent TLS 1.3 implementation available to all RabbitMQ 3.11 users.
