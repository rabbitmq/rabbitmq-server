## RabbitMQ 4.1.6

RabbitMQ `4.1.6` is a maintenance release in the `4.1.x` [release series](https://www.rabbitmq.com/release-information).

It is **strongly recommended** that you read [4.1.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v4.1.0)
in detail if upgrading from a version prior to `4.1.0`.


### Minimum Supported Erlang Version

[RabbitMQ and Erlang/OTP Compatibility Matrix](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/which-erlang) has more details on Erlang version requirements for RabbitMQ.

Nodes **will fail to start** on older Erlang releases.


## Changes Worth Mentioning
