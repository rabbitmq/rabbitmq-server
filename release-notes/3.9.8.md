#### Bug Fixes

* When the mandatory flag was used when publishing to classic queues,
  but publisher confirms were not, channels memory usage would grow indefinitely.

  GitHub issue: [#3560](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/3560)

* `rabbitmq-diagnostics memory_breakdown` failed to read memory of connection
  reader, writer and channel processes.

  GitHub issue: [#3570](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/3570)

* In some environments, Stream replicas returned IP addresses that could not be reached by other RabbitMQ nodes
  (eg. IP addresses behind a NAT in a Docker deployment). RabbitMQ hostnames are now returned as well so that other
  nodes in the cluster can resolve them to get an externally visible IP address.
