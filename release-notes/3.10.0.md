## Highlights





## Obtaining Packages

RabbitMQ releases are distributed via [GitHub](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases), [Cloudsmith](https://cloudsmith.io/~rabbitmq/repos/), and [PackageCloud](https://packagecloud.io/rabbitmq).


### Erlang/OTP Compatibility Notes

This release [requires Erlang 23.2](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) or later. Erlang 24 is recommended as it [offers 20%-50% throughput improvements](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2021/03/erlang-24-support-roadmap/) for many workloads.

[Provisioning Latest Erlang Releases](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html#erlang-repositories) explains what package repositories and tools can be used to provision latest patch versions of Erlang 23.3.x and 24.x.



## Upgrading to 3.10

See the [Upgrading guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) for documentation on upgrades and [RabbitMQ change log](https://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html) for release notes of other releases.

RabbitMQ 3.10.0 nodes can run alongside `3.9.x` nodes. `3.10.x`-specific features can only be made available when all nodes in the cluster
upgrade to 3.10.0 or any other patch release in the series.

While operating in mixed version mode, some aspects of the system may not behave as expected. The list of known behavior changes is covered below.
Once all nodes are upgraded to 3.10.0, these irregularities will go away.

Mixed version clusters are a mechanism that allows rolling upgrade and are not meant to be run for extended
periods of time (no more than a few hours).



## Compatibility Notes

### Client Library Compatibility

Client libraries that were compatible with RabbitMQ `3.9.x` will be compatible with `3.10.0`.


### Upgrading to Erlang 24.x

RabbitMQ `3.8.16` and later require Erlang `23.2` and support Erlang `24` (recommended).
Users of RabbitMQ versions that [do not support Erlang 23.2](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) should first upgrade to the latest `3.8.x` patch release on Erlang 23.2,
then upgrade to `3.10.0`, and ideally Erlang 24.


### Getting Help

Any questions about this release, upgrades or RabbitMQ in general are welcome on the [RabbitMQ mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rabbitmq-users).



## Changes Worth Mentioning

Release notes are kept under [rabbitmq-server/release-notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/tree/v3.10.x/release-notes).


### Core Server

#### Enhancements

 * Reduced memory footprint of quorum queues. Quorum queues now move enqueues messages to disk as quickly as
   possible, ignoring the `x-max-in-memory-length` and `x-max-in-memory-bytes` policy keys. This reduces per-queue memory footprint
   and makes throughput and latency less variable.

   GitHub issue: [#3898](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/3898)

 * New classic queue index and message store implementations. This makes memory footprint of classic queues less variable
   and on average, lower than before. Consumer delivery is more efficient, potentially increasing throughput for workloads
   where consumers do keep up with producers.

   This implementation is not enabled by default. It can be enabled using a policy:

   ``` shell
   rabbitmqctl set_policy cq_version "^hf\." '{"queue-version": 2}' --priority 1 --apply-to queues
   ```

   or set via `rabbitmq.conf`:

   ``` ini
   classic_queue.default_version = 2
   ```
   GitHub issue: [#3029](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3029)

 * Quorum queues now support [message TTL](https://rabbitmq.com/ttl.html).

   GitHub issue: [#3121](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3121)

 * Reduced per-queue garbage collection.

   GitHub issue: [#4110](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4110)

 * Stream replication connections now adopt [TLS settings configured for inter-node communication links](https://rabbitmq.com/clustering-ssl.html).

   GitHub issue: [#3553](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3553)

 * Quorum queues now support two [dead lettering](https://rabbitmq.com/dlx.html) strategies, at-most-once (the 3.9 quorum queue and classic queue behavior)
   and at-least-once.

   To use at-least-once the user must opt-in.

   GitHub issue: [#3100](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/3100)

 * Messages delivered by a quorum queue and negatively acknowledged with a requeue will be added to the back of the queue
   until the queue has redelivery limit set. With a redelivery limit, requeueing will use the original position of the message
   if possible.

   This improves operational safety: consumers that get stuck or requeue deliveries at a high rate will not indefinitely
   grow quorum queue Raft log, potentially driving the node out of disk space.

   This is a **potentially breaking change**. Applications can make sure quorum queues have a redelivery limit
   set if the original behavior is important to keep.

   GitHub issue: [#3776](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/3776)

 * [Boot time definition sync](https://rabbitmq.com/definitions.html#import-on-boot) now can be skipped if definition source (e.g. file or directory) contents
   have not changed:

   ``` ini
   definitions.skip_if_unchanged = true

   definitions.import_backend = local_filesystem
   definitions.local.path = /path/to/definitions/defs.json
   ```

   GitHub issue: [#4062](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4062)

 * Classic mirrored queues peak eager sync throughput now can be limited.

   GitHub issue: [#3925](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3925)


#### Internal API and Other Changes

 * Inter-node message transfer is optimized for the case where a message is only routed to one queue.

   Contributed by @tomyouyou.

   GitHub issue: [#3865](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3865)

 * Elixir 1.13 is now supported at build time.

   GitHub issue: [#4108](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4108)


#### Bug Fixes

This release includes all bug fixes that shipped in `3.9.x` releases.

 * Addressed a performance regression for large fanouts when streams were not enabled.

   GitHub issue: [#4073](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4073)

 * Channels could confirm a subset of messages published as mandatory in some cases.

   GitHub issue: [#3870](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3870)

 * Direct Erlang client initialisation had a race condition with earlier boot steps,
   which could lead plugins that depend on it to fail to open connections.

   GitHub issue: [#3685](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3685)

 * Exclusive queues are always placed on local node.

   [Exclusive queues](https://rabbitmq.com/queues.html#exclusive-queues) are by definition node-local because they are tied to the lifecycle of
   their declaring connection, which is node-local.

   GitHub issue: [#3341](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3341)


### OAuth 2 AuthN and AuthZ Backend Plugin

 * Improvements to JKW support and new HTTPS settings.

   Contributed by @anhanhnguyen (Erlang Solutions).

   GitHub issue: [#3887](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3887)


### Shovel Plugin

#### Bug Fixes

 * Shovels with automatic deletion threshold of `0` are now correctly deleted immediately.

   Contribited by @luos (Erlang Solutions).

   GitHub issue: [#4098](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4098)
