RabbitMQ `3.10.20` is a maintenance release in the `3.10.x` [release series](https://www.rabbitmq.com/versions.html).

This series [**reaches its end of community support** on July 31st, 2023](https://rabbitmq.com/versions.html).

Please refer to the upgrade section from [v3.10.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.10.0)
if upgrading from a version prior to 3.10.0.

This release **requires Erlang 24.3** and supports Erlang 25.
[RabbitMQ and Erlang/OTP Compatibility Matrix](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) has more details on
Erlang version requirements for RabbitMQ.


### Minimum Supported Erlang Version

Erlang 23 and 24 versions older than 24.3 have reached [end of support](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html).

This release of RabbitMQ [requires Erlang 24.3.4.8](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-packaging/pull/35)
or later versions. Nodes **will fail to start** on older Erlang releases.

Erlang 25.3 is recommended: it offers much improved performance on ARM64 architectures, [profiling with flame graphs](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2022/05/flame-graphs/)
across all architectures, and the most recent TLS 1.3 implementation.

   definitions.skip_if_unchanged = false
   definitions.import_backend = local_filesystem
   definitions.local.path = /path/to/RabbitMQ/definitions/conf.d/
   ```
