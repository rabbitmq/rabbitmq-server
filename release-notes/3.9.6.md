### Core Server

#### Bug Fixes

* TLS information delivered in [Proxy protocol](https://www.rabbitmq.com/networking.html#proxy-protocol) header is now attached to connection metrics as if it was provided by a non-proxying client.

  GitHub issues: [#3175](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3175), [#3371](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3371) contributed by @prefiks, sponsored by CloudAMQP

 * `max_message_size` had a one-off error in the validator.

   GitHub issue: [#3398](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3398)

 * `mirroring_sync_batch_size` was incorrectly validated as if it represented batch size in bytes.
   It represents batch size in number of messages, so the new default hard cap is now 1M (a very high number that's impractical)

   GitHub issue: [#3398](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3398)

### Stream Plugin

#### Bug Fixes

 * Offset parameters were not stored correctly in some cases.

   GitHub issue: [#3360](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3360), contributed by @korsmakolnikov

 * Partitions list order is now stable.

   GitHub issue: [#3423](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3423)

 * When stream clients close connections abruptly, publisher and consumer metrics get cleaned up correctly.

   GitHub issue: [#3340](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3340)

 * Classic queue shutdown now uses a much higher timeout (up to 10 minutes instead of 30 seconds).

   In environments with many queues (especially mirrored queues) and many consumers this means that
   the chance of queue indices rebuilding after node restart is now substantially lower.

   GitHub issue: [#3409](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3409)


### Management Plugin

#### Enhancements

  * Stream publishers are now listed on the individual stream page.

    GitHub issue: [#3389](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/3389)

  * Counters have been added to the tiles of several sections on detail pages.

    GitHub issue: [#3422](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3422)
