### Core Server

#### Bug Fixes

 * TLS information delivered in [Proxy protocol](https://www.rabbitmq.com/networking.html#proxy-protocol) header is now attached to connection metrics as if it was provided by a non-proxying client.

   GitHub issue: [#3175](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3175) contributed by @prefiks, sponsored by CloudAMQP

 * Classic queue shutdown now uses a much higher timeout (up to 10 minutes instead of 30 seconds).

   In environments with many queues (especially mirrored queues) and many consumers this means that
   the chance of queue indices rebuilding after node restart is now substantially lower.

   GitHub issue: [#3409](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3409)


## Dependency Upgrades

 * observer_cli has been upgraded from `1.6.2` to `1.7.1`
