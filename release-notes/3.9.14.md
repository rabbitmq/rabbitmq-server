### Core Server

#### Bug Fixes

 * Restart of a node that hosted one or more stream leaders resulted in
   their consumers not "re-attaching" to the newly elected leader.

   GitHub issue: [#4133](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/4133)

 * Large fanouts experienced a performance regression when streams were not
   enabled using a feature flag.

   GitHub issue: [#4086](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4086)

 * Stream management plugin did not support mixed version clusters.

   GitHub issue: [#4082](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/4082)

 * Stream deletion did not result in a `basic.cancel` being sent to AMQP 0-9-1 consumers.

   GitHub issue: [#4192](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/4192)

 * Stream clients did not receive a correct stream unavailability error in some
   cases.

   GitHub issue: [#4117](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4117)

 * It is again possible to clear user tags and update the password in a single operation.

   GitHub issue: [#4126](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4126)

#### Enhancements

   GitHub issue: [#4256](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4256)

   are now handled gracefully.

   GitHub issue: [#4090](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4090)

 * Temporary hostname resolution issues (attempts that fail with `nxdomain`)
   are now handled more gracefully and with a delay of several seconds.

   GitHub issue: [#4233](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4233)

 * Build time compatibility with Elixir 1.13.

   GitHub issue: [#4019](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/4019)


### OAuth 2 AuthN/AuthZ Backend Plugin

#### Bug Fixes

 * `auth_oauth2.additional_scopes_key` in `rabbitmq.conf` was not converted correctly
   during configuration translation and thus had no effect.

   GitHub issue: [#4105](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4105)
