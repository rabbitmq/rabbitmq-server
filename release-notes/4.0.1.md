## RabbitMQ 4.0.1

RabbitMQ `4.0` is a new major release.

Starting June 1st, 2024, community support for this series will only be provided to [regularly contributing users](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/main/COMMUNITY_SUPPORT.md)
and those who hold a valid [commercial support license](https://tanzu.vmware.com/rabbitmq/oss).

## Highlights

Some key improvements in this release are listed below.

 * [Khepri](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whVqpgvep90), an [alternative schema data store](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/7206) developed to replace Mnesia,
   has matured and is now fully supported (it previously was an experimental feature)
 * [AMQP 1.0 is now a core protocol](https://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2024/08/05/native-amqp) that is always enabled. Its plugin is now a no-op that only exists to simplify upgrades.
 * The AMQP 1.0 implementation is now significantly more efficient: its peak throughput is [more than double than that of 3.13.x](https://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2024/08/21/amqp-benchmarks)
   on some workloads
 * Efficient sub-linear [quorum queue recovery on node startup using checkpoints](https://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2024/08/28/quorum-queues-in-4.0#faster-recovery-of-long-queues)
 * Quorum queues now [support priorities](https://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2024/08/28/quorum-queues-in-4.0#message-priorities) (but not exactly the same way as classic queues)
 * [AMQP 1.0 clients now can manage topologies](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/10559) similarly to how AMQP 0-9-1 clients do it
 * The AMQP 1.0 convention (address format) used for interacting with with AMQP 0-9-1 entities [is now easier to reason about](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/next/amqp#addresses)
 * Mirroring (replication) of classic queues [was removed](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/9815) after several years of deprecation. For replicated messaging data types,
   use quorum queues and/or streams. Non-replicated classic queues remain and their development continues
 * Classic queue [storage efficiency improvements](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/11112), in particular recovery time and storage of multi-MiB messages
 * Nodes with multiple enabled plugins and little on disk data to recover now [start up to 20-30% faster](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/10989)
 * New exchange type: [Local Random Exchange](https://rabbitmq.com/docs/next/local-random-exchange)

See Compatibility Notes below to learn about **breaking or potentially breaking changes** in this release.

## Breaking Changes and Compatibility Notes

### Classic Queues is Now a Non-Replicated Queue Type

After three years of deprecation, classic queue mirroring was completely removed in this version.
[Quorum queues](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/quorum-queues) and [streams](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/streams) are two mature
replicated data types offered by RabbitMQ 4.x. Classic queues continue being supported without any breaking changes
for client libraries and applications but they are now a non-replicated queue type.

After an upgrade to 4.0, all classic queue mirroring-related parts of policies will have no effect.
Classic queues will continue to work like before but with only one replica.

Clients will be able to connect to any node to publish to and consume from any non-replicated classic queues.
Therefore applications will be able to use the same classic queues as before.

See [Mirrored Classic Queues Migration to Quorum Queues](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/migrate-mcq-to-qq) for guidance
on how to migrate to quorum queues for the parts of the system that really need to use replication.

### Quorum Queues Now Have a Default Redelivery Limit

Quorum queues now have a default [redelivery limit](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/next/quorum-queues#poison-message-handling) set to `20`.
Messages that are redelivered 20 times or more will be [dead-lettered](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/dlx) or dropped (removed).

This limit is necessary to protect nodes from consumers that run into infinite fail-requeue-fail-requeue loops. Such
consumers can drive a node out of disk space by making a quorum queue Raft log grow forever without allowing compaction
of older entries to happen.

If 20 deliveries per message is a common scenario for a queue, a dead-lettering target or a higher limit must be configured
for such queues. The recommended way of doing that is via a [policy](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/parameters#policies).
See the [Position Messaging Handling](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/next/quorum-queues#poison-message-handling) section
in the quorum queue documentation guide.

Note that increasing the limit is recommended against: usually the presence of messages that have been redelivered 20 times or more suggests
that a consumer has entered a fail-requeue-fail-requeue loop, in which case even a much higher limit
won't help avoid the dead-lettering.

For specific cases where the RabbitMQ configuration cannot be updated to include a dead letter policy
the delivery limit can be disabled by setting a delivery limit configuration of `-1`. However, the RabbitMQ team
strongly recommends keeping the delivery limit in place to ensure cluster availability isn't
accidentally sacrificed.

### AMQP 0.9.1 x-death header

Up to RabbitMQ 3.13, when an AMQP 0.9.1 client (re-)published a message to RabbitMQ, RabbitMQ interpreted the
AMQP 0.9.1 [`x-death`](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/dlx#effects) header in the published message's `basic_message.content.properties.headers` field.

RabbitMQ 4.x will not interpret this `x-death` header anymore when clients (re-)publish a message.
Note that RabbitMQ 4.x will continue to set and update the `x-death` header every time a message is dead-lettered, including when a client **rejects** the message.

Applications that rely on RabbitMQ incrementing the `count` fields within the `x-death` header array elements for new messages **(re-)published**
(instead of existing messages being rejected), should introduce and increment [a separate `x-` header](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/10709#issuecomment-1997083246),
with a name that would not be updated by RabbitMQ itself.

### CQv1 Storage Implementation was Removed

CQv1, [the original classic queue storage layer, was removed](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/10656)
except for the part that's necessary for upgrades to CQv2 (the 2nd generation).

In case `rabbitmq.conf` explicitly sets `classic_queue.default_version` to `1` like so

``` ini
# this configuration value is no longer supported,
# remove this line or set the version to 2
classic_queue.default_version = 1
```

nodes will now fail to start. Removing the line will make the node start and perform
the migration from CQv1 to CQv2.

### Settings `cluster_formation.randomized_startup_delay_range.*` were Removed

The following two deprecated `rabbitmq.conf` settings were [removed](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/12050):
```
cluster_formation.randomized_startup_delay_range.min
cluster_formation.randomized_startup_delay_range.max
```
RabbitMQ 4.0 will fail to boot if these settings are configured in `rabbitmq.conf`.

### Several Disk I/O-Related Metrics were Removed

Several I/O-related metrics are dropped, they should be [monitored at the infrastructure and kernel layers](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/monitoring#system-metrics)

### Default Maximum Message Size Reduced to 16 MiB

Default maximum message size is reduced to 16 MiB (from 128 MiB).

The limit can be increased via a `rabbitmq.conf` setting:

```ini
# 32 MiB
max_message_size = 33554432
```

However, it is recommended that such large multi-MiB messages are put into a blob store, and their
IDs are passed around in messages instead of the entire payload.

### AMQP 1.0

RabbitMQ 3.13 `rabbitmq.conf` setting `rabbitmq_amqp1_0.default_vhost` is unsupported in RabbitMQ 4.0.

Instead `default_vhost` will be used to determine the default vhost an AMQP 1.0 client connects to(i.e. when the AMQP 1.0 client
does not define the vhost in the `hostname` field of the `open` frame).

Starting with RabbitMQ 4.0, RabbitMQ strictly validates that
[delivery annotations](https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0-os.html#type-delivery-annotations),
[message annotations](https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0-os.html#type-message-annotations), and
[footer](https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0-os.html#type-footer) contain only
[non-reserved annotation keys](https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0-os.html#type-annotations).
As a result, clients can only send symbolic keys that begin with `x-`.

### MQTT

RabbitMQ 3.13 [rabbitmq.conf](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/configure#config-file) settings `mqtt.default_user`, `mqtt.default_password`,
and `amqp1_0.default_user` are unsupported in RabbitMQ 4.0.

Instead, set the new RabbitMQ 4.0 settings `anonymous_login_user` and `anonymous_login_pass` (both values default to `guest`).
For production scenarios, [disallow anonymous logins](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/next/production-checklist#anonymous-login).

### TLS Client (LDAP, Shovels, Federation) Defaults

Starting with Erlang 26, client side [TLS peer certificate chain verification](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/ssl#peer-verification) settings are enabled by default in most contexts:
from federation links to shovels to TLS-enabled LDAP client connections.

If using TLS peer certificate chain verification is not practical or necessary, it can be disabled.
Please refer to the docs of the feature in question, for example,
this one [on TLS-enabled LDAP client](http://rabbitmq.com/docs/ldap/#tls) connections,
two others on [TLS-enabled dynamic shovels](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/shovel#tls) and [dynamic shovel URI query parameters](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/uri-query-parameters).

### Shovels

RabbitMQ Shovels will be able connect to a RabbitMQ 4.0 node via AMQP 1.0 only when the Shovel runs on a RabbitMQ node >= `3.13.7`.

TLS-enabled Shovels will be affected by the TLS client default changes in Erlang 26 (see above).


## Erlang/OTP Compatibility Notes

This release [requires Erlang 26.2](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/which-erlang).

[Provisioning Latest Erlang Releases](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/which-erlang#erlang-repositories) explains
what package repositories and tools can be used to provision latest patch versions of Erlang 26.x.


## Release Artifacts

RabbitMQ releases are distributed via [GitHub](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases).
[Debian](https://rabbitmq.com/docs/install-debian/) and [RPM packages](https://rabbitmq.com/docs/install-rpm/) are available via
repositories maintained by the RabbitMQ Core Team.

[Community Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq/), [Chocolatey package](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/rabbitmq), and the [Homebrew formula](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/install-homebrew)
are other installation options. They are updated with a delay.

### Known Issue: Incorrect Version in Generic Binary Builds

Generic binary builds of `4.0.1` incorrectly report their version as `4.0.0+2`. This also applies to plugin versions. This was [addressed in `4.0.2`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v4.0.2).

Other artifacts (Debian and RPM packages, the Windows installer) are not affected.


## Upgrading to 4.0

### Documentation guides on upgrades

See the [Upgrading guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/upgrade) for documentation on upgrades and [GitHub releases](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases)
for release notes of individual releases.

This release series only supports upgrades from `3.13.x`.

This release requires **all feature flags** in the 3.x series (specifically `3.13.x`) to be enabled before upgrading,
there is no upgrade path from 3.12.14 (or a later patch release) straight to `4.0.0`.

### Required Feature Flags

This release [graduates](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/feature-flags#graduation) all feature flags introduced up to `3.13.0`.

All users must enable all stable [feature flags] before upgrading to 4.0 from
the latest available 3.13.x patch release.

### Mixed version cluster compatibility

RabbitMQ 4.0.0 nodes can run alongside `3.13.x` nodes. `4.0.x`-specific features can only be made available when all nodes in the cluster
upgrade to 4.0.0 or a later patch release in the new series.

While operating in mixed version mode, some aspects of the system may not behave as expected. The list of known behavior changes will be covered in future updates.
Once all nodes are upgraded to 4.0.0, these irregularities will go away.

Mixed version clusters are a mechanism that allows rolling upgrade and are not meant to be run for extended
periods of time (no more than a few hours).

### Recommended Post-upgrade Procedures

#### Configure Dead Lettering or Increase the Limit for Frequently Redelivered Messages

In environments where messages can experience 20 redeliveries, the affected queues should have [dead lettering](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/dlx)
configured (usually via a [policy](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/parameters#policies)) to make sure
that messages that are redelivered 20 times are moved to a separate queue (or stream) instead of
being dropped (removed) by the [crash-requeue-redelivery loop protection mechanism](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/next/quorum-queues#poison-message-handling).

Alternatively, the limit can be [increased](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/next/quorum-queues#poison-message-handling) using a policy.
This option is recommended against: usually the presence of messages that have been redelivered 20 times or more suggests
that a consumer has entered a fail-requeue-fail-requeue loop, in which case even a much higher limit
won't help avoid the dead-lettering.
