RabbitMQ `3.11.26` is a maintenance release in the `3.11.x` [release series](https://www.rabbitmq.com/versions.html).
This release series [goes out of community support on Dec 31, 2023](https://rabbitmq.com/versions.html).

Please refer to the upgrade section from [v3.11.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.11.0)
if upgrading from a version prior to 3.11.0.

This release requires Erlang 25 and supports Erlang versions up to `25.3.x`.
[RabbitMQ and Erlang/OTP Compatibility Matrix](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) has more details on
Erlang version requirements for RabbitMQ.


### Minimum Supported Erlang Version

As of 3.11.0, RabbitMQ requires Erlang 25. Nodes **will fail to start** on older Erlang releases.

Erlang 25 as our new baseline means much improved performance on ARM64 architectures, [profiling with flame graphs](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2022/05/flame-graphs/)
across all architectures, and the most recent TLS 1.3 implementation available to all RabbitMQ 3.11 users.


## Changes Worth Mentioning

### Core Broker

#### Bug Fixes

 * When a topic permission was deleted, an [internal event](https://rabbitmq.com/logging.html#internal-events) of type `permission.deleted`
   was emitted in some cases, instead of `topic.permission.deleted`.

   Investigated by @bedia.

### AMQP 1.0 Plugin

#### Bug Fixes
