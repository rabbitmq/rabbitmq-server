%% Normally we'd call mnesia:dirty_select/2 here, but that is quite
%% expensive for the same reasons as above, and, additionally, due to
%% mnesia 'fixing' the table with ets:safe_fixtable/2, which is wholly
%% unnecessary. According to the ets docs (and the code in erl_db.c),
%% 'select' is safe anyway ("Functions that internally traverse over a
%% table, like select and match, will give the same guarantee as
%% safe_fixtable.") and, furthermore, even the lower level iterators
%% ('first' and 'next') are safe on ordered_set tables ("Note that for
%% tables of the ordered_set type, safe_fixtable/2 is not necessary as
%% calls to first/1 and next/2 will always succeed."), which
%% rabbit_route is.
